# **Twitter US Airline Sentiment Analysis**

In this project I have tried using various **Machine learning models** and **Deep Learning LSTM Models** to perform seniment analysis of the tweet data given by the passengers and then classifying the tweets as positive or negative, with 0 being negative and 1 being positive.
The performance of each of the models is being compared.

The data was trained on the following models:


*   **Logistic Regression**
*   **Support Vector Classifier**
*   **Decision Tree Classifier**
*   **Random Forest Classifier**
*   **AdaBoost Classifier**
*   **Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier**
*   **Simple Deep Learning model**
*   **LSTM Model**
